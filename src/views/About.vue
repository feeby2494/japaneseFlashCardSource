        <p>
          I built this Japanese study flashcard and quiz app to get back
          into studying Japanese and to use what I've learned from freecodecamp and udemy.
          I want to become a better front end developer and understand both Javascript and Japanese better!
          Thank you for taking a look at my app.
          If you have any feedback, then please email me at <a href="mailto:toby2494@hotmail.com">toby2494@hotmail.com</a>
